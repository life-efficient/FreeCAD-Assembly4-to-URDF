- set material and infill properties in freecad
- correctly extract material properties in script
- apply joint constraints
- fix scale


checklist
- joint origins are aligned to have coincident axes
- meshes are offset by inverse of previous joint parent placement
- joint transforms are computed as inverse of previous joint parent placement @ child joint placement
- mesh transforms apply joint alignment
- ensure axis of rotation is correctly set
